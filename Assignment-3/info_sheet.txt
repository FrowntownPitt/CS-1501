None.


Additional comments to the grader:

I asked Dr. Lipschultz about the data types of certain input, and he
said it was up to the students to decide.

price -> int
size  -> int
zip   -> int
Apt # -> int

Also, the String inputs are case sensitive, i.e. Pittsburgh != pittsburgh

I added error handling to some parts of input, but not all.  Enter
malformed input at your own risk!
