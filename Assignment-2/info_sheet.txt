Assignment #: 2

Program due date: 10/14/2016

Handed in date: 10/11/2016

Source code file name(s):
 MyLZW.java
 All other prviously included files


Other file name(s) (if relevant):
 None


Does your program run without error?: It appears so.  All files compress and expand yielding the original file.

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:

I am not sure why, but my monitor mode compressed all.tar to a larger file size than the original, but it
decompressed fine.  I tried my monitor with a .STEP file (a CAD model) and it reset through monitor mode and
was compressed much smaller than the original.  Since it decompresses properly, monitor mode works as it should.

Additional comments to the grader:
 The results.txt was formatted with a fixed-width font, and it must be read without word wrap, otherwise it may
 be hard to read.
